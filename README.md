## ‚≠êÔ∏è Application Features:

- [x] Trending Recipes list
- [x] Filter by difficulty
- [x] Animations
- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Loading

## üìÑ Approach and Decisions:

### Project Structure
I structured the project using Next.js to take advantage of its server-side rendering capabilities, which ensure fast initial load times and SEO benefits. The components are organized in a way that promotes reusability and maintainability.

### API Simulation
I simulated an API request to fetch the recipe data on client-side. This approach mimics real-world scenarios where data would typically come from a backend service. The simulated API request allows for easy adaptation to a real API in the future.

### Filtering Logic
For the filtering by difficulty, I implemented a system where:

- All recipes are displayed, but those matching the selected difficulty are highlighted with a distinct border color and ordered first in the list. This decision was made to meet the challenge requirements while enhancing the user's ability to visually differentiate recipes based on difficulty.

### UI/UX Design
- Styled-components: I used styled-components to meet the challenge requirements and also to encapsulate the styles within the components, ensuring a modular and maintainable design. It also allowed me to inject keyframe animations easily.
- Responsiveness: The application is fully responsive, with media queries and flexible layouts to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Animations: I implemented animations for the difficulty filter and recipe cards to create a more engaging user experience. The animations are subtle but add a dynamic feel to the interactions.

### Challenges Encountered
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring that the page content was styled correctly even during the initial load. To address this:

- I leveraged Next.js's built-in CSS handling and optimized the styled-components setup to prevent any flash of unstyled content (FOUC) by adding a spinner when the data is being fetched. This approach ensured a smooth and visually consistent user experience.
